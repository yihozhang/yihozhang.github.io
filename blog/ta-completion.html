<h1 class="title">Ensuring the Termination of EqSat over a Terminating
Term Rewriting System</h1>
<p class="author">Yihong Zhang</p>
</header>
<p>Term rewriting is one of the most fundamental techniques in
programming languages. It is used to define program semantics, to
optimize programs, and to check program equivalences. An issue with
using term rewriting to optimize program is that, it is usually not
clear which rule should be applied first, among all the possible rules.
Equality saturation (EqSat) is a variant of term rewriting that
mitigates this so-called Phase-Ordering Problem. In EqSat, all the rules
are applied at the same time, and the resulting program space is stored
compactly in a data structure called E-graph<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>EqSat has been shown to be very successful for program optimizations
and program equivalence checking, even when the given set of rewrite
rules are not terminating or even when the theory is not decidable in
general. However, despite its success in practice, there are no formal
guarantees about EqSat: for example, when does EqSat terminate, and if
it does not, how does one make it terminate. The first problem is known
in the term rewriting literature as the termination problem, and the
second is known as the completion problem. Both problems are very hard,
and there are a ton of literatures on both problems. In the setting of
EqSat, these problems are not only theoretically interesting, both also
have practical implications. For example, in program optimization, we
may want to get the most “optimized” term with regard to a given set of
rules, so making sure EqSat terminate is important to such optimality
guarantees. Or, you may know some theory is decidable but deciding it is
slow, so you want to speed up the reasoning by using EqSat, but there is
no point in “speeding up” EqSat if it simply does not terminate. In this
post, we will focus on the termination problem of EqSat. As it turns
out, there are many interesting, and even surprising, results, about the
termination problem with EqSat.</p>
<p>This post will show (1) how the innocent-looking associativity rule
can cause non-termination, (2) why a terminating, and even canonical,
term rewriting system does not necessarily terminate in EqSat, (3) how
to fix the above problem by “weakening” EqSat’s merge operation, and (4)
two potentially promising approaches to ensure the termination of EqSat.
One fascinating thing I found during this journey is that, researchers
working on tree automata indeed developed a technique almost identical
to EqSat, known as Tree Automata (TA) completion. Different from EqSat,
TA Completion does not have the problem in (2) and is exactly the
algorithm we will show in (3). Moreover, there is a beautiful connection
between EqSat and TA completion: TA completion is the “preorder” version
of EqSat.</p>
<h2
id="term-rewriting-101-ground-theories-are-decidable-via-congruence-closure">Term
rewriting 101: Ground theories are decidable via congruence closure</h2>
<p>Before understanding why associativity can cause non-termination, let
us first briefly review some relevant backgrounds on ground theories and
congruence closure.</p>
<p>A ground equational theory is an equational theory induced by a
finite set of ground identities of the form <span
class="math inline">\(s\approx t\)</span>, where both <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are ground terms (i.e., no variables).
For example, below is an example of a ground theory over signature <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma={a,b,c,f,g}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  a&amp;\approx f(b)\\
  b&amp;\approx g(c)\\
  f(g(c))&amp;\approx f(a)\\
\end{align*}\]</span> All the equations that can be implied by the three
identities are true in this equational theory. For example, we have
<span class="math inline">\(a\approx f(b)\approx f(g(c))\approx
f(a)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\approx
f(g(c))\)</span> holds because we have <span
class="math inline">\(b\approx g(c)\)</span>. In equational theory, a
function by definition maps equivalent inputs to equivalent outputs.</p>
<p>A classical result in term rewriting and logic is that the word
problem of ground equational theory is decidable. A (ground) word
problem asks whether two ground terms <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are equivalent in a given theory. In
general, this problem is undecidable. However, if the theory is ground,
several algorithms exist that decide its word problem. The most famous
one is probably the <span class="math inline">\(O(n \log n)\)</span>
congruence closure algorithm of Downey, Sethi, and Tarjan. One way to
view the congruence closure algorithm is that it produces a canonical
term rewriting system for each input set of ground identities: For each
input theory <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, it builds the
corresponding E-graph, and every E-graph corresponds to a canonical term
rewriting system. For example, the congruence closure algorithm will
produce the following E-graph for the theory above: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
c_a&amp;=\{a, f(c_a), f(c_b)\}\\
c_b&amp;=\{b, g(c_c)\}\\
c_c&amp;=\{c\}
\end{align*}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_a, c_b,
c_c\)</span> denote E-classes of the E-graph, and <span
class="math inline">\(a,b,c,f(c_a), f(c_b), g(c_c)\)</span> denote
E-nodes. This E-graph naturally gives the following canonical term
rewriting system <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, which rewrite
terms to the e-classes they are in from bottom to top: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
a&amp;\rightarrow_G c_a\\
f(c_a)&amp;\rightarrow_G c_a\\
f(c_b)&amp;\rightarrow_G c_a\\
b&amp;\rightarrow_G c_b\\
g(c_c)&amp;\rightarrow_G c_b\\
c&amp;\rightarrow_G c_c\\
\end{align*}\]</span> Now, checking <span class="math inline">\(s\approx
t\)</span> can be simply done by checking if there exists some normal
form <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(s\rightarrow^*_G u \leftarrow^*_Gt\)</span> holds.
For example, <span class="math inline">\(g(f(a))\approx
g(f(g(c)))\)</span> because <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
g(f(a))&amp;\rightarrow_Gg(f(c_a))\\
&amp;\rightarrow_Gg(c_a)\\
&amp;\leftarrow_G g(f(c_b)) \\
&amp;\leftarrow_Gg(f(g(c_c))\\
&amp;\leftarrow_Gg(f(g(c))))
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This is sound and always terminates, because the term rewriting
system produced by an E-graph is canonical–meaning every term will have
exactly one normal form and term rewriting always terminates.</p>
<h2 id="ground-associative-theory-does-not-terminate-in-eqsat">Ground
associative theory does not terminate in EqSat</h2>
<p>Associativity is the fundamental law to many algebraic structures
like semigroups, monoids, and groups. It has the following form: <span
class="math display">\[x\cdot (y\cdot z)\approx (x\cdot y)\cdot
z.\]</span> This rule can be oriented as <span
class="math inline">\(x\cdot (y\cdot z)\rightarrow (x\cdot y)\cdot
z\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(x\cdot (y\cdot z)\rightarrow
(x\cdot y)\cdot z\)</span>). This rule must be terminating, you may
think, so we can just apply the rule until saturation in EqSat, which
will decide ground theories with associativity! Unfortunately, ground
associative theories are not decidable in general. The book <em>Term
Rewriting and All That</em> gives an example (we write <span
class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\cdot
y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\cdots x\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> for brevity and associativity allows
us to drop brackets): <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
(xy)z&amp;\approx x(yz)\\
aba^2b^2&amp;\approx b^2a^2ba\\
a^2bab^2a&amp;\approx b^2a^3ba\\
aba^3b^2&amp;\approx ab^2aba^2\\
b^3a^2b^2a^2ba&amp;\approx b^3a^2b^2a^4\\
a^4b^2a^2ba&amp;\approx b^2a^4
\end{align*}\]</span> There is another way to state this proposition
that appeals to math-minded persons: the word problem for finitely
presented semigroups are not decidable.</p>
<p>Because of this, associative rules do not terminate in EqSat in
general. To show this, suppose otherwise it is terminating, given a set
of ground identities <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, we run the
congruence closure algorithm over <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>
to get E-graph, and run both directions of the associativity. When it
reaches the fixed point and terminates, this gives us a way to decide
ground associative theories, which is a contradiction to the fact that
such theories are not decidable.</p>
<p>To better understand why associativity does not terminate in EqSat,
here is an example: suppose <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>
is associative and satisfy the ground identity <span
class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\approx 0\)</span> for constants <span
class="math inline">\(0,a\)</span>. Now suppose we orient this identity
into rewrite rule <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\rightarrow
0\)</span> while having the associative rule <span
class="math inline">\((x\cdot y)\cdot z\rightarrow x\cdot(y\cdot
z)\)</span>. This is a terminating term-rewriting system (although not
confluent, because the term <span class="math inline">\((0\cdot a)\cdot
a\)</span> has two normal forms <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot(a\cdot a)\)</span>).</p>
<p>However, this ruleset causes problems in EqSat: Starting with the
initial term <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\)</span>, EqSat will
apply the rewrite rule <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\rightarrow
0\)</span> and merge <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> into the same E-class. The
E-graph will look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/0a=a.png" class="center" style="width:50.0%"
alt="0\cdot a=a" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span class="math inline">\(0\cdot
a=a\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that because of the existence of cycles in this E-graph, it
represents not only the two terms <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot a\)</span> but indeed an infinite
set of terms. For example, using the term rewriting system analogy of
E-class above, <span class="math inline">\((0\cdot a)\cdot a\)</span> is
<em>explicitly</em> represented by E-class <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> because <span
class="math display">\[(0\cdot a)\cdot a\rightarrow^* (q_0\cdot
q_a)\cdot q_a\rightarrow q_0\cdot q_a\rightarrow q_0.\]</span> In fact,
<span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> represents the infinite set of
terms <span class="math display">\[0\cdot a\approx(0\cdot a)\cdot
a\approx ((0\cdot a)\cdot a)\cdot a\approx\cdots.\]</span> For any such
term <span class="math inline">\((0\cdot a)\cdot\cdots\)</span>, it can
be rewritten to a term of the form <span class="math inline">\(0\cdot
(a\cdot \cdots)\)</span>. Now, for associativity to terminate, the
output E-graph need to at least represent the set of terms <span
class="math inline">\(a,a\cdot a,(a\cdot a)\cdot a,\cdots\)</span>,
where any two terms are not equal. This requires infinitely many
E-classes, each represents some <span
class="math inline">\(a^n\)</span>, while a finite E-graph will have
only a finite number of E-classes. Therefore, EqSat will not terminate
in this case.</p>
<h2
id="canonical-trss-do-not-necessarily-terminate-in-eqsat-as-well">Canonical
TRSs do not necessarily terminate in EqSat as well</h2>
<p>In our last example, the term rewriting system <span
class="math inline">\(R=\{0\cdot a\rightarrow 0,(x\cdot y)\cdot
z\rightarrow x\cdot (y\cdot z)\}\)</span> is terminating, but it is not
confluent. Confluence means that every term will have at most one normal
form, and associativity is usually not confluent. One may be tempted to
think that maybe non-confluence is what causes EqSat to not terminate.
But it is not the case; there are canonical (i.e., terminating +
confluent) TRSs that are non-terminating in EqSat. Here we give such an
example: Let the TRS <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
h(f(x), y) &amp;\rightarrow h(x, g(y))\\
h(x, g(y)) &amp;\rightarrow h(x, y)\\
f(x) &amp;\rightarrow x
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a terminating term rewriting system, where every term of the
form <span class="math inline">\(h(f^n(a), g^m(b))\)</span> will have
the normal form <span class="math inline">\(h(a, b)\)</span>, no matter
the order of rule application. However, this is not terminating in
EqSat: consider the initial term <span class="math inline">\(h(f(a),
b)\)</span>. Running the rule <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\rightarrow x\)</span> over the initial
E-graph will union <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> together, creating an infinite (but
regular) set of terms <span class="math inline">\(h(f^*(a), b)\)</span>.
See figure.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/hf*ab.png" class="center" style="width:50.0%"
alt="An E-graph that represents h(f^*(a), b)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An E-graph that represents <span
class="math inline">\(h(f^*(a), b)\)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, by rule <span class="math inline">\(h(f(x), y) \rightarrow h(x,
g(y))\)</span>, each <span class="math inline">\(h(f^n(a), b)\)</span>
will be rewritten into <span class="math inline">\(h(a,
g^n(b))\)</span>, so the output E-graph must contain <span
class="math inline">\(g^n(b)\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. But notice that the rule
set will not rewrite any <span class="math inline">\(g^n(b)\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(g^m(b)\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n\neq m\)</span>, which means that we have an
infinite set of inequivalent terms <span
class="math inline">\(b\not\approx g(b)\not\approx g^2(b)\not\approx
\ldots\)</span>. Again, the existence of infinitely many e-classes, one
for each <span class="math inline">\(g^n(b)\)</span>, implies that EqSat
will not terminate.</p>
<h2 id="tree-automata-completion-to-the-rescue">Tree Automata Completion
to the Rescue</h2>
<p>I hope, just like me, you will find the above observations somewhat
surprising. Intuitively, one will think that EqSat is just a more
powerful way of doing term rewriting. And for a terminating TRS, the set
of reachable terms is always finite<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is natural to
think that running EqSat with a terminating TRS starting with some
initial term will eventually terminate. But this is not true, as has
been shown in the last two sections. The issue is because EqSat is not
exactly term rewriting: the equivalence in EqSat is bidirectional. For
example, in our last example, the rewrite from <span
class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does not only make the E-graph
represent these two terms, but also <span
class="math inline">\(f(f(a))\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f(f(f(a)))\)</span> and so on.</p>
<p>Before going further, let us first formally define the related
problem where we expect terminating TRSs to enjoy the termination
property. For a TRS <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we define
the set of reachable terms <span class="math inline">\(R^*(s)=\{t\mid
s\rightarrow_R^* t\}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
is terminating, <span class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span> is finite
for any term <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. It can also be
shown that EqSat always computes a superset of <span
class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span>. A natural idea is that if our
EqSat procedure can compute exactly <span
class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span>, it is likely to terminate for
terminating TRSs. And in fact it is capable of handling TRSs beyond
terminating ones: E-graphs can represent many infinite sets of terms.
This problem itself is interesting to study and has applications in
areas like program verification.</p>
<p>It turns out, term rewriting researchers have developed a technique
that computes exactly <span class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span>,
represented as a tree automaton. The technique is known as <strong>tree
automata completion</strong>, which is the main technique I hope to
introduce in this blog post. In term rewriting, completion essentially
means “term-rewriting a term rewriting system” (usually to make the term
rewriting system canonical). Tree automata completion proceeds as
follows: build an initial tree automaton and run term rewriting over
this tree automaton until saturation. Specifically, it searches for
left-hand sides of rewrite rules, build and insert right-hand sides, and
merge the left-hand sides with right-hand sides. Does this sound
familiar? Yes, this is EqSat! It is striking to me that the program
optimization and term rewriting communities independently come up with
essentially the same technique.</p>
<p>But wait a second, didn’t we just say EqSat does not necessarily
compute <span class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span> exactly? This is
correct. There is a single tweak that distinguishes tree automata
completion from EqSat. In tree automata completion, merging is performed
directionally. For example, suppose the left-hand side is in E-class
<span class="math inline">\(q_l\)</span> and right-hand side in E-class
<span class="math inline">\(q_r\)</span>, EqSat will basically rename
every occurrence of <span class="math inline">\(q_l\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(q_r\)</span> (or vice versa). As a result the two
E-classes are not distinguishable after the merging.</p>
<p>Tree automata completion, on the other hand, performs the merging by
adding a new transition <span class="math inline">\(q_r\rightarrow
q_l\)</span> (remember the TRS view of an E-graph). This allows tree
automata completion to add only terms from the right-hand side to the
E-graph.</p>
<p>To better see the difference, consider the E-graph that represents
terms <span class="math inline">\(\{f(a), g(b)\}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
a&amp;\rightarrow q_a\\
f(q_a)&amp;\rightarrow q_f\\
b&amp;\rightarrow q_b\\
g(q_b)&amp;\rightarrow q_g
\end{align*}\]</span> and the rewrite <span
class="math inline">\(a\rightarrow b\)</span>. EqSat will rename <span
class="math inline">\(q_b\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(q_a\)</span> (or <span
class="math inline">\(q_b\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(q_a\)</span>), so every E-node that points to
child <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (resp. <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) now also points to <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (resp. <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). The E-graph after the merging will
now contain <span class="math inline">\(\{f(a), f(b), g(a),
g(b)\}\)</span>. Note that among these terms, <span
class="math inline">\(g(a)\)</span> is not reachable by the TRS; the
rewrite rule <span class="math inline">\(a\rightarrow b\)</span> can
only rewrite <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">\(g(b)\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(g(a)\)</span>. In contrast, tree automata
completion will add the transition <span
class="math inline">\(q_b\rightarrow q_a\)</span>. Recall that we say a
term <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is represented by an E-class
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in an E-graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(t\rightarrow_G^* q\)</span>. With the above
transition, we have every term represented by <span
class="math inline">\(q_a\)</span> is now represented by <span
class="math inline">\(q_b\)</span>, but not the other way around. As a
consequence, <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span> is represented by
the E-graph, since <span class="math display">\[f(b)\rightarrow
f(q_b)\rightarrow f(q_a)\rightarrow q_f,\]</span> while <span
class="math inline">\(g(a)\)</span> is not in the E-graph.</p>
<p>This difference guarantees that tree automata completion will only
contain terms that can is reachable by the TRS at any moment. Moreover,
if tree automata completion terminates, it will compute exactly <span
class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span>. The actual tree automata
completion is slightly more general than this: instead of considering
the set of reachable terms of a single initial term, it considers the
set of reachable terms of an initial tree automaton, which may contain
an infinite set of terms. It turns out, although the set of reachable
terms of a single term <span class="math inline">\(R^*(s)\)</span> is
always finite (and thus regular) if <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is terminating, it is <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220815000504">undecidable</a>
if the set of reachable terms is regular or not given an initial tree
automaton even when <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is
terminating and confluent. To ensure the termination of tree automata
completion even when the reachable set is not regular, researchers have
proposed approximation algorithms for tree automata completion, which
are useful for applications like program verification.</p>

<p><em>Equivalence and pre-order</em>. One interesting way of viewing
tree automata completion is that <em>it generalizes the equivalence
relation in EqSat to a preorder</em>: EqSat maintains an equivalence
relation <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> between terms and
asserts <span class="math inline">\(l\sigma \approx r\sigma\)</span> for
every left-hand side <span class="math inline">\(l\sigma\)</span> and
right-hand side <span class="math inline">\(r\sigma\)</span>. EqSat also
guarantees that if <span class="math inline">\(t[a]\)</span> is in the
E-graph and <span class="math inline">\(a\approx b\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(t[b]\)</span> is also in the E-graph and <span
class="math inline">\(t[a]\approx t[b]\)</span><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Tree automata completion, instead, maintains a <em>preorder</em>
relation <span class="math inline">\(\lesssim\)</span> and asserts <span
class="math inline">\(l\sigma\lesssim r\sigma\)</span> for every
left-hand side <span class="math inline">\(l\sigma\)</span> and
right-hand side <span class="math inline">\(r\sigma\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(l\sigma\lesssim r\sigma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(l\sigma\gtrsim r\sigma\)</span> in tree automata
completion is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(l\sigma \approx
r\sigma\)</span> in equality saturation, and in such cases <span
class="math inline">\(l\sigma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\sigma\)</span> can be viewed as one state.
Moreover, tree automata completion guarantees that if <span
class="math inline">\(t[a]\)</span> is in the tree automaton and <span
class="math inline">\(a\lesssim b\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(t[b]\)</span> is also in the tree automaton and
<span class="math inline">\(t[a]\lesssim t[b]\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Implementation of tree automata completion</em>. I have not
implemented tree automata completion, but it would be interesting to see
how to implement tree automata completion in an EqSat framework like
egg. It seems we only need to make two modifications: First, during
rewrite, instead of merging left-hand side and right-hand side, adding
an edge from the left-hand side to the right-hand side (or equivalently,
an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>-edge from the
right-hand side to the left-hand side). As an optimization, we can merge
two states together if they are in the same strongly connected
component. Second, modify the matching procedure so that it will also
“follow” these <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>-transitions. The new matching
procedure can no longer be expressed as a conjunctive query, as opposed
to EqSat, and is more expensive to compute. In general, though, tree
automata completion has a higher time complexity than equality
saturation, since dealing with DAGs / SCCs are more difficult than
dealing with equivalences.</p>
<p><em>The termination problem of TA completion</em>. We have shown
above that given a terminating TRS <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and an initial term <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, tree automata completion is always
terminating but EqSat may not terminate, which shows that the
termination of tree automata completion does not imply the termination
of EqSat. But is the other direction true? Indeed, the termination of
EqSat does not imply the termination of tree automata completion as
well! To see this, consider <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
f(x)&amp;\rightarrow_R g(f(h(x)))\\
h(x)&amp;\rightarrow_R b
\end{align*}\]</span> For tree automata completion to terminate, the set
of reachable terms must be regular. However, for initial term <span
class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span>, the set of reachable terms is <span
class="math display">\[\{g^n(f(h^n(a)))\mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}\cup
\{g^n(f(h^m(b)))\mid n&gt;m\},\]</span> which is not regular. In EqSat,
because equivalence is bidirectional, all the <span
class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> are in the same E-class as <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, so the first rewrite rule can be
effectively viewed as <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\rightarrow_R
g(f(b))\)</span>, where the right-hand side is a ground term. As a
result, there are only a finite number of equivalence classes in the
theory defined by the rewrite rules, which implies the termination of
equality saturation.</p>
