                <p>Start with a quick review of sequences and series, followed by more material on this topic, then say more about differential equations (switching to the Boyce-DiPrima text), winding up with parametrized curves, as in Chapters 13-14 of Salas-Hille. Class time is very intensive, and class notes are very helpful.</p>

                <p>Number one class I will recommend for Chinese students who are interested in indigenous feminist issues and feminist history. Although the course name is <i>Gender and Sexuality in China</i>, I think it will be more appropriate to call it <i>Queer China's History: Gender, Sexuality, and Beyond</i>. This is more like an anthropology course rather than a gender study course since it's not like other gender study courses that someone may think as (western leftist) ideology-based. One of the main course text <i>Women and China's Revoluition</i> asks at the beginning of the book: What will the history be like if we put women at the center of the history? Do women also have a revolution? We all know that history is made up by male figures, like the concept of universal equality in <i>Declaration of Independece</i> doesn't include women, and the leaders of May Fourth movement, the members of Long March are all conceived as man (who is heterosexual). So what role does women play in the history, the book asked. At the meanwhile, gender, as a fundamental relationship of the society, reflects other relationships and ideological conflicts in history. For example, how is the image of Woman created and recreated throughout time, and what purpose do these images serve? Beyond this, GWSS 328 also covers topics like nationalism, modernity discourse, socialism, the relation between hypermasculinity, nationalism, and neoliberalism, footbindings and body politics, Marxism's idea on women's emanicipation, gendered internal orientalism, and so on. One optional reading even covered nationalism, colonialism, and hypermasculinity in <i>Wolf Warrior II</i> (《战狼II》). The last a few weeks will focus more on sexuality in China, like lesbian and gay communities, the history of gay identities, and the academical debates between the "universal" queer theory and Chinese Marxism queer theory.

                <p>ENGL 131 W: Composition: Expositions</p>

                <p>Interesting writing courses which talks about lots of critical thinking topics through different genres of literature. Focus on the exploring the effect of unreliable narrators and discovering what's under the text.</p>

        <h4>Courses (18au)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143x/18au/">CSE 143X: Computer Programming I/II (accelerated)</a></p>

                <p>A very competitive introductory course but high GPAs are slightly more attainable than CSE 142/143. Many people spend a large amount of time to do repetitive and tedious stuffs, like checking their coding and commenting styles thousands of times, to secure a high GPA. Feel free to skip lectures and quizs, but don't make any critical mistake in your assignments. Available for every autumn.</p>

                <p><a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mcgovern/134au18/">MATH 134: Honors Accelerated Calculus</a></p>

                <p>Talks about derivatives and integrals with more analysis and proofs, as well as some further knowledge MATH 124/125 don't cover. Monty is a very approachable and passionate professor, but he just doesn't look at his students when teaching classes.</p>

                <p><a href="https://gwss.washington.edu/courses/2018/autumn/gwss/200/a">GWSS 200: Introduction to Women Studies</a></p>

                <p>Professor Amanda is very warm and nice. Readings are interesting and cover wide topics and lay you a foundation of feminism and beyond feminism over different periods. The course is designed to be transnational but largely it's still US-centered. There are many interesting in-class films and few homeworks. Overall, it's a really, really inspiring course. Enjoy your readings!</p>
